## Join the Robotics Revolution!
Learn Robotics was founded with the purpose of bringing high-quality robotics and programming classes to the Greater Indianapolis community.

If you hadn't already guessed it, WE LOVE ROBOTS & we think you'll love them too! <i class="fa fa-android" aria-hidden="true"></i> 


Face it, automation, software, and robots are all around us. We live in a world packed with tech, computers, and "smart" devices. Let us teach you how to join this Robotics Revolution with class offerings such as Robotics Foundations and Electronics & Sensing.

## Who We Are
We love to teach youth how to develop, construct, code, and play with, you guessed it, **ROBOTS**! <br>

Started by Robotics Engineer, Liz Miller, Learn Robotics is an organization focused on bringing quality introductory and intermediate robotics classes to youth and young adults.

Liz holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Robotics Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. She has taught 100's of introductory robotics classes to elementary, middle, and high school students throughout New England. Liz's most recent teaching gig was at Massachusetts Institute of Technology! Liz works full-time in high-volume automated manufacturing where she maintains robotic arms and industrial equipment. Liz's love for teaching robotics led her to design and launch Learn Robotics within the Greater Indianapolis community! <br><br><br>

## What We Do
A big part of Learn Robotics is overcoming the learning curve of beginning robot programming. We pride ourselves on making classes engaging, interactive, and informative. *Quality education is our #1 goal, but having fun is our #1 priority!* 
The curriculum for each Learn Robotics class is designed so that students of varying backgrounds will have a functioning robot to use in class challenges!
